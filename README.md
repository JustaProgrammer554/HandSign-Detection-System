# HandSign-Detection-System
This project is about a robotic hand that connected to arduino. The arduino uses transceiver to connect to a raspberry pi with a hand sign detection program in it. When the camera detects a sign, it will send specific signal to the arduino and make the robotic hand to imitate the sign.
